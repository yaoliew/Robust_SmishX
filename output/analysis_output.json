    "rationales": "The SMS claims to be from Kotak Bank and mentions a mobile verification process, which could be mistaken for a legitimate security alert. However, the provided URL 'kotak.comfraud' is highly suspicious. The HTML content summary indicates that this domain could not be resolved, suggesting it is likely a non-existent or incorrect domain, which casts doubt on its legitimacy. Additionally, the screenshot description of the URL shows a login page seemingly belonging to Amazon, not Kotak Bank. This discrepancy between the content and claimed source indicates a potential phishing attempt. It is common for phishing sites to use alarming language, such as 'Warn!' and 'REPORT FRAUD,' to induce panic and prompt the recipient to act quickly without considering the legitimacy. Moreover, there are no search results for 'kotak.comfraud,' which further suggests it is not a legitimate domain associated with Kotak Bank. The fact that the page directs users to what appears to be an Amazon login page is a significant red flag, suggesting that the attackers may be attempting to harvest login credentials under the guise of another service.",

    "advice": "This SMS is a phishing attempt. The URL provided does not resolve to a legitimate domain and is used to mislead recipients. Do not respond to this message or click on any links. Contact Kotak Bank directly using official contact channels if you suspect any unauthorized activity."

  "user_friendly_output": "This message is likely a phishing attempt and should be treated with caution. The link in the message is suspicious, as it doesn't direct to a legitimate Kotak Bank website and even tries to impersonate another page to trick you. It's best not to click on any links or provide any personal information; if you're worried about your account, contact Kotak Bank directly using a trusted phone number or website.",
  "detection_prompt": "I want you to act as a spam detector to determine whether a given SMS is phishing, spam, or legitimate. Your analysis should be thorough and evidence-based. Analyze the SMS by following these steps:\n        1. If the SMS is promoting any of the following categories: Online gambling, bets, spins, adult content, digital currency, lottery, it is either spam or phishing.\n        2. The SMS is legitimate if it is from known organizations, such as appointment reminders,  OTP (One-Time Password) verification, delivery notifications, account updates, tracking information, or other expected messages.\n        3. The SMS is considered legitimate if it involves a conversation between friends, family members, or colleagues.\n        4. Promotions and advertisements are considered spam. The SMS is spam if it is promotion from legitimate companies and is not impersonating any brand, but it is advertisements, app download promotions, sales promotions, donation requests, event promotions, online loan services, or other irrelevant information.\n        5. The SMS is phishing if it is fraudulent and attempts to deceive recipients into providing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Phishing SMS may exhibit the following characteristics:\n        Promotions or Rewards: Some phishing SMS offer fake prizes, rewards, or other incentives to lure recipients into clicking links or providing personal information.\n        Urgent or Alarming Language: Phishing messages often create a sense of urgency or fear, such as threats of account suspension, missed payments, or urgent security alerts.\n        Suspicious Links: Phishing messages may contain links to fake websites designed to steal personal information.\n        Requests for Personal Information: Phishing SMS may ask for sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other personal details.\n        Grammatical and Spelling Errors: Many phishing messages contain grammatical mistakes or unusual wording, which can be a red flag for recipients.\n        Expired Domain: Phishing websites often use domains that expire quickly or are already listed for sale.\n        Inconsistency: The URL may be irrelevant to the message content.\n        6. Please be aware that: It is common to see shortened URLs in SMS. You can get the expanded URL from the provided redirection chain. Both phishing and legitimate URLs can be shortened. And both phishing and legitimate websites may use a robot-human verification page (CAPTCHA-like mechanism) before granting access the content.\n        7. I will provide you with some external information if there is a URL in the SMS. The information includes:\n        - Redirect Chain: The URL may redirect through multiple intermediate links before reaching the final destination; if any of them is flagged as phishing, the original URL becomes suspicious.\n        - Brand Search Information:  The top five results from a Google search of the brand name. You can compare if the URL's domain matches the results from Google.\n        - Screenshot Description: A description of the website's screenshot, highlighting any notable visual elements.\n        - HTML Content Summary: The title of HTML, and the summary of its content.\n        - Domain Information: The domain registration details, including registrar, creation date, and DNS records, which are analyzed to verify the domain's legitimacy.\n        8. Please give your rationales before making a decision. And your output should be in json format and should not have any other output:\n        - brand\\_impersonated: brand name associated with the SMS, if applicable.\n        - URL: any URL appears in SMS, if no URL, answer \"non\".\n        - rationales: detailed rationales for the determination, up to 500 words. Directly give sentences, do not categorize the rationales. Only tell the reasons why the SMS is legitimate or not, do not include the reasons why the SMS is spam or phishing.\n        - brief\\_reason: brief reason for the determination.\n        - category: True or False. If the SMS is legitimate, output False. Else, output True.\n        - advice: If the SMS is phishing, output potential risk and your advice for the recipients, such as ''Do not respond to this message or access the link.''\n\n        Below is the information of the SMS:\n- SMS to be analyzed: Warn!
