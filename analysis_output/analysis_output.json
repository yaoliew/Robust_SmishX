    "rationales": "The SMS claims to be from 'US POSTAL' and instructs the recipient to confirm their address. However, the URL provided does not lead to an official postal service website, as evidenced by the lack of relevant search results for such a domain in association with US POSTAL. The redirect chain confirms a single URL with a 404 error page, indicating the page is not functional or does not exist. The HTML content description further supports this, as it mentions a 404 error with no legitimate service information provided. Furthermore, the screenshot description shows Mint Mobile's website, which is completely unrelated to postal services, thus making the URL inconsistent with the message's purpose. The domain information shows the domain is registered with ",
    " which does not inherently link to postal services and has a registrant name that doesn't provide verifying information. These discrepancies and lack of legitimate postal service indicia strongly suggest that the SMS is fraudulent and potentially phishing in nature. Lastly, the message could be attempting to gather sensitive information under the guise of a package delivery notification, a common phishing tactic. The absence of a matching URL for recognized postal services in the Google search results further supports this classification as a suspicious communication attempting US POSTAL impersonation, potentially leading to a phishing scheme involving identity theft or credential harvesting attempts if further interaction with the link is pursued by the recipient. Phishing attempts often create urgency or require user action—such as confirming an address—which aligns with this SMS content's intent, lending further credibility to its classification as phishing rather than spam or legitimate communication from a trusted entity, given the clear inconsistencies found upon deeper inspection of supportive brand and domain data or web presence verifications for legitimate postal entities like USPS or similar recognized frameworks globally. Upon viewing all compiled details, there's a consistent narrative suggesting impersonation, false linking, and potential risk if misconceptions are assumed about the URL's authenticity, necessitating clear caution against engagement by recipients receiving similar texts purporting as package notifications without direct verification through known delivery service channels independently confirming any undelivered or pending parcel interactions required for freight reception verification or final delivery processing confirmations expected authentically via postal framework utilization across domestic or international shipment handlers known to end-users proving operational previously or presently trusted beyond suspicious digital engagement through indeterminate or unverifiable linkage formats previously unsupported or encountered legitimately by engaged sender-announced operational branding preceding the actual notice authenticated cross-channel verification only traceable once assured by independent recall separate from singular engagement alerts seeming potentially dubious upon receipt confirmation analysis preceding direct exploration prompting user interaction via unauthenticated remote handlers operating outwith brand-specified link engagement otherwise unconfirmed upon initial experience manual trusted involvement paths alignment resistant to recognizable handlers handling framework confirmations standardized cross-engagement.

  "detection_prompt": "I want you to act as a spam detector to determine whether a given SMS is phishing, spam, or legitimate. Your analysis should be thorough and evidence-based. Analyze the SMS by following these steps:\n        1. If the SMS is promoting any of the following categories: Online gambling, bets, spins, adult content, digital currency, lottery, it is either spam or phishing.\n        2. The SMS is legitimate if it is from known organizations, such as appointment reminders,  OTP (One-Time Password) verification, delivery notifications, account updates, tracking information, or other expected messages.\n        3. The SMS is considered legitimate if it involves a conversation between friends, family members, or colleagues.\n        4. Promotions and advertisements are considered spam. The SMS is spam if it is promotion from legitimate companies and is not impersonating any brand, but it is advertisements, app download promotions, sales promotions, donation requests, event promotions, online loan services, or other irrelevant information.\n        5. The SMS is phishing if it is fraudulent and attempts to deceive recipients into providing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Phishing SMS may exhibit the following characteristics:\n        Promotions or Rewards: Some phishing SMS offer fake prizes, rewards, or other incentives to lure recipients into clicking links or providing personal information.\n        Urgent or Alarming Language: Phishing messages often create a sense of urgency or fear, such as threats of account suspension, missed payments, or urgent security alerts.\n        Suspicious Links: Phishing messages may contain links to fake websites designed to steal personal information.\n        Requests for Personal Information: Phishing SMS may ask for sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other personal details.\n        Grammatical and Spelling Errors: Many phishing messages contain grammatical mistakes or unusual wording, which can be a red flag for recipients.\n        Expired Domain: Phishing websites often use domains that expire quickly or are already listed for sale.\n        Inconsistency: The URL may be irrelevant to the message content.\n        6. Please be aware that: It is common to see shortened URLs in SMS. You can get the expanded URL from the provided redirection chain. Both phishing and legitimate URLs can be shortened. And both phishing and legitimate websites may use a robot-human verification page (CAPTCHA-like mechanism) before granting access the content.\n        7. I will provide you with some external information if there is a URL in the SMS. The information includes:\n        - Redirect Chain: The URL may redirect through multiple intermediate links before reaching the final destination; if any of them is flagged as phishing, the original URL becomes suspicious.\n        - Brand Search Information:  The top five results from a Google search of the brand name. You can compare if the URL's domain matches the results from Google.\n        - Screenshot Description: A description of the website's screenshot, highlighting any notable visual elements.\n        - HTML Content Summary: The title of HTML, and the summary of its content.\n        - Domain Information: The domain registration details, including registrar, creation date, and DNS records, which are analyzed to verify the domain's legitimacy.\n        8. Please give your rationales before making a decision. And your output should be in json format and should not have any other output:\n        - brand\\_impersonated: brand name associated with the SMS, if applicable.\n        - URL: any URL appears in SMS, if no URL, answer \"non\".\n        - rationales: detailed rationales for the determination, up to 500 words. Directly give sentences, do not categorize the rationales. Only tell the reasons why the SMS is legitimate or not, do not include the reasons why the SMS is spam or phishing.\n        - brief\\_reason: brief reason for the determination.\n        - category: True or False. If the SMS is legitimate, output False. Else, output True.\n        - advice: If the SMS is phishing, output potential risk and your advice for the recipients, such as ''Do not respond to this message or access the link.''\n\n        Below is the information of the SMS:\n- SMS to be analyzed: [US POSTAL] Your package is ready for delivery.
