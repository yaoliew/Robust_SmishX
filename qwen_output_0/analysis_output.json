  "detection_prompt": "I want you to act as a spam detector to determine whether a given SMS is phishing, spam, or legitimate. Your analysis should be thorough and evidence-based. Analyze the SMS by following these steps:\n1. If the SMS is promoting any of the following categories: Online gambling, bets, spins, adult content, digital currency, lottery, it is either spam or phishing.\n2. The SMS is legitimate if it is from known organizations, such as appointment reminders, OTP (One-Time Password) verification, delivery notifications, account updates, tracking information, or other expected messages.\n3. The SMS is considered legitimate if it involves a conversation between friends, family members, or colleagues.\n4. Promotions and advertisements are considered spam. The SMS is spam if it is promotion from legitimate companies and is not impersonating any brand, but it is advertisements, app download promotions, sales promotions, donation requests, event promotions, online loan services, or other irrelevant information.\n5. The SMS is phishing if it is fraudulent and attempts to deceive recipients into providing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Phishing SMS may exhibit the following characteristics:\nPromotions or Rewards: Some phishing SMS offer fake prizes, rewards, or other incentives to lure recipients into clicking links or providing personal information.\nUrgent or Alarming Language: Phishing messages often create a sense of urgency or fear, such as threats of account suspension, missed payments, or urgent security alerts.\nSuspicious Links: Phishing messages may contain links to fake websites designed to steal personal information.\nRequests for Personal Information: Phishing SMS may ask for sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other personal details.\nGrammatical and Spelling Errors: Many phishing messages contain grammatical mistakes or unusual wording, which can be a red flag for recipients.\nExpired Domain: Phishing websites often use domains that expire quickly or are already listed for sale.\nInconsistency: The URL may be irrelevant to the message content.\n6. Please be aware that: It is common to see shortened URLs in SMS. You can get the expanded URL from the provided redirection chain. Both phishing and legitimate URLs can be shortened. And both phishing and legitimate websites may use a robot-human verification page (CAPTCHA-like mechanism) before granting access the content.\n7. I will provide you with some external information if there is a URL in the SMS. The information includes:\n- Redirect Chain: The URL may redirect through multiple intermediate links before reaching the final destination; if any of them is flagged as phishing, the original URL becomes suspicious.\n- Brand Search Information: The top five results from a Google search of the brand name. You can compare if the URL's domain matches the results from Google.\n- Screenshot Description: A description of the website's screenshot, highlighting any notable visual elements.\n- HTML Content Summary: The title of HTML, and the summary of its content.\n- Domain Information: The domain registration details, including registrar, creation date, and DNS records, which are analyzed to verify the domain's legitimacy.\n8. Please give your rationales before making a decision. And your output should be in JSON format and should not have any other output:\n- brand_impersonated: brand name associated with the SMS, if applicable.\n- URL: any URL appears in SMS, if no URL, answer \"non\".\n- rationales: detailed rationales for the determination, up to 500 words. Directly give sentences, do not categorize the rationales. Only tell the reasons why the SMS is legitimate or not, do not include the reasons why the SMS is spam or phishing.\n- brief_reason: brief reason for the determination.\n- category: True or False. If the SMS is legitimate, output False. Else, output True.\n- advice: If the SMS is phishing, output potential risk and your advice for the recipients, such as \"Do not respond to this message or access the link.\"\n\nBelow is the information of the SMS:\n- SMS to be analyzed: Shipped: Your Amazon packagewith Old Spice High EnduranceDeodorant, Pure Sport, 3.0 oz,5... will be delivered Tue, May24. Track at http://a.co/4SJitSA\n- URL: http://a.co/4SJitSA\n- Redirect Chain of http://a.co/4SJitSA: [('http://a.co/4SJitSA', 404)]\n- Html Content Summary of http://a.co/4SJitSA: The website content is a sign-in page for an Amazon account. Users are prompted to enter their mobile number or email, and if the input is invalid, they are asked to try again.
